# password-cracker
an simulator for how long it would take to crack an password without delay

# Warning!
This does not 'crack' an password as it only simulates how long it would take to bruteforce an password by already knowing the password and compares the every combination with the password.
It will time the crack and how many different combinations it has tried.
This program can be resource heavy as it literally tries every combination of letters.
